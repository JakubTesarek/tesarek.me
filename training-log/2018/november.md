I stoped losing weight. In last 3 days I even gained 0.1kg. It can be because I didn't do any high intensity workout in those last 3 days because of my injury. I cannot reduce my food any more. Yeasterday I had one small chickpeas salad and chicken tortilla for lunch; and steamed brocolli with small pork steak and one slice of wholewheat bread and one orange for dinner. I was barely full so reducing my portion size is not possible.

Today I was on [InBody measurement](/media/09-11-2018-inbody.png).

Today kickbox training was very tough. 1. there was a lot of people so we did a lot of cardio. 2. I haven't eat much since I'm still cutting weight. At the end of the training I was seriously running out of energy.

I gained some weight since yesterday despite eating just 2 meals. Today visited a halloween party in my gym and had some salty snacks and peanuts coated in sugar. It was nowhere near a full meal. ut it was definitely a cheat. I ate it just because it was there.

The afternoon kickbox training was great. The main group of people who go there are actual fighters and they take the training seriously. They are also in great shape and I would learn a lot in there. They also train more often and I want to train more anyway. But I also want to keep training technique with Filip because this training gives me a lot. I don't know if he would be willing to train with me if I start training elsewhere.

Another advantage of training with Penta is that it's above E.R.S workout gym so I could do a strength training and boxin in one gym. On other hand they don't have a speedbag for general use so I would not have access to this.

### Afternoon
> Excercise of the day: Stay in your guard and then squat down and as you go up do a push kick. Alternate legs with each leg. Alternatively you can do a sprawl instead of squat.

- 65x sit-up
- 65x squat
