### Afternnon
- 1,5 hours group training
  - I'm diping for no reason, I should wait for an attack and then counter-attack with a dip
  - I need to keep my eyes on my opponent
  - Keep the elbows tucked to my body to avoid hard body shots
  - When I'm under heavy punches, don't turn sideways to the opponent
  - I have to stop droping my hands when lowkicking
  - Ducking and weaving worked reasonably well against slower opponents but not agains skilled fighters
  - Relax!
