### Morning

- 2,000m rowing / 7:15 (2s improvement since last time)
- 85 roundhouse kicks with each leg to a heavy bag

I planned to do 100 kicks with each leg but after 85 a huge hematoma formed on my righ instep so I stopped. I can walk and it doesn't hurt much. I'm icing the foot. I had to cancel a private gymnastics lesson in jumpark. I don't want to injur myself even more.

Pull-ups up today: 21,550

During lunch I had one more piece of focaccia than I originally planned. I also drank a protein shake. Therefore I decided to go for very light dinner. I'm proud that I managed to stick to my plan. I had just a salad with leafy greens and grilled goat cheese.
