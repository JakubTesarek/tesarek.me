I skipped morning warm-up because I was late to my morning training. I also slept very poorly. My dog wasn't feeling good and was waking me every 2 hours.

I'm starting to feel like I'm having a flu. I have this weird feeling in my throat. But I still plan to go to evening training. I'll have a full rest day tomorrow.
