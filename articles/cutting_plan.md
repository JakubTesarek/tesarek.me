# Cutting plan
Since I've got in shape my weight was stale and I never get to lose the remaining fat to get to single digits fat percentage. I plan to shed some weight and get a visible six-pack until this summer.

As Alan Roberts from Every Damn Day Fitness says in [his book "Uncensored"](https://everydamndayfitness.net/collections/ebooks/products/uncensored), losing fat is just Math and Willpower (In my oppinion of course). Btw. if you haven't buy and read the book.

## The math part
It's time to do some math and figure out, what I have to do.

### Calories

First thing is my BMR (*Basal Metabolic Rate*). That's the number of calories my body burns just to keep my alive. There's multiple formulas how to calculate it, none of them is 100% precise but [Harris Benedict](https://manytools.org/handy/bmr-calculator/) is reccomended by Alan.

My BMR : 1930Kcal

Next thing I need to know is TDEE (*Total Daily Energy Expenditure*). That's the amount of calories I need to neither lose or gain weight.

There are basically two ways to calculate it. Either I can just calculate energy expenditure of everythng I do and add it to my BMR. Or I just multiply my BMR by some coeficient based on my lifestyle. In first case it means logging everything. In second case I have to select one options without really knowing what they mean. What is "Moderatly physical work, heavy excercise"? And what if I have seated work but heavy excercise? Those options just don't make any fucking sense.

So I've decided to calculate my TDEE as if I had absolutely no activity. And I will estimate number of calories I burn out by excercise each week, divide by 7 and just add it my TDDE.

TDEE 2316Kcal (1930Kcal x 1.2)

Usually I have strength training on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday and Sunday. It usually takes me and hour (I'm not counting warmup and stretching). With my weight it should be around 5 x 520Kcal = 2600Kcal.

I also have Monday-Friday kickbox training. It's also around 5 hours (again not counting warmup and stretching). In total it's around 5 x 950Kcal = 4750Kcal.

On average I burn 7350 / 7 = 1050Kcal each day just by excercise.

> Notice that it's ~70% of my BMR. So next time some retard tells you that excercise burns only small amount compared to BMR and it's not reliable way to lose weight, tell them to stop being lazy fucks and actually start working out. Running on treadmill doesn't count.

Back to math. In total I burn 3366Kcal per day. That would correspond to multiplier of 1,74 (Moderatly physical work/heavy excercise.)

I'm currently 83,5kg and my lean body mass, last time it got checked, was 71,7kg. It means I have 14% body fat (11.7kg). Not good.
I want to get under 10% body fat (let's say 9%). That means my final weight will be 78,8 with ~7kg fat. I have to lose 4.7kg of fat.

Each kilogram of body is about 7700Kcal therefore I have to create total deficit of 36190Kcal. So basically if I don't eat for 10 days I should be shredded mofo. But I'll probably go for more realistic 500kcal deficit each day. That's 72 days of consistently eating 2866kcal or less.

### Macros
I have 71.7kg (~158lbs) of lean mass and I need around 1g of protein per pound per day. Let's say 160g. Each gram of protein is 4kcal so that's 640kcal that I have to each each day just in protein. I have 2226kcal that I can eat in fat and carbs.

I don't really care about the ratio of fat and carbs in my diet. I plan to continue eating whole foods - meat, eggs and vegetables,
nuts, sometimes wholewheat bread, pasta or rice. Therefore the other macronutrients naturaly take care of themself. But just out of curiosity:

[It's usually recomended for a male to eat around 30% of calories in fat](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320773.php). 30% x 2226kcal = 668kcal. Let's round it to 670Kcal. Each gram of fat has 9Kcal (more or less) so that's 74grams of fat daily.

The rest 1556Kcal I'll eat in carbs. Each gram of cabs is 4Kcal. 1556 / 4 = 389g daily.

But as I said, I don't really care if I eat more carbs or fat. I plan to track my protein and overall calories and that's it.

## Simplifications
I've skippped lot of details in my calculations. This is not exact science and I only care about the big picture.

For start I'm ommiting TEF ([Thermic effect of food](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_dynamic_action)). It can be calculate more precisely but in general it's around 10% of all calories you consume. In my case, it would be 10% x 2866Kcal = 286Kcal.

I also don't count lot of activities I usually do. I walk the stairs every time I have the chance. And it's a lot of stairs. I also walk my dog and every weekend I go for at least 3 hours long hike.

On the other hand, the number of calories on packages can be off by up to 20%. Even if you take 2 chicken breasts with exactly the same weight, they can drasticaly differ in number of calories based on the fat content, water etc.

I'll also not count small calorie inputs like 2Kcal in my tea or 6kcal in my coffee. 

## Adjustments
All the 

My BMR after this cut should be 1827. With the same activity multiplier that TDEE of 3Â 178kcal. My TDEE will be lower by 188kcal.
That mean I will have to eat 188kcal/day less just to not gain weight. And to keep losing weight with the same rate I'll have to slowly adjust
to eat only 2670kcal. And when I'm done I'll add around 500kcal back.
