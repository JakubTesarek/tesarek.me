# Cutting plan



My BMR (Harris Benedict): 1930 / https://manytools.org/handy/bmr-calculator/
TDEE
 - 1930x1.2 = 2 316 with no activity
 
 
 usually I have strength training on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday and Sunday = 5 hours = 5x520kcal = 2 600
 I also have Monday-Friday kickbox training 5 hours = 5x950kcal = 4 750
 thats 1050kcal per day on average on activity
 
 in total that would be 3366kcal/day, 1,74 times my BMR which corresponds to Moderatly Physical work/heavy excercise
 
 
For simplicity I'm skipping the thermogenic effect of food. If I eat to my TDEE, it should be around 336kcal (10%) per day.
I also don't count my walks with a dog and other low intensity activities. But I also don't count calories from coffee with milk.

I'm currently 83.5kg and my lean body mass last time it got checked was 71.7kg which means I have 14% body fat (11.7kg).
I want to get under 10% (let's say 9%), that means my final weight will be 78,8 with ~7kg fat. Tha mean I have to lose 4.7kg of fat.

Each kilogram of body is about 7700kcal and it means I have to create a deficit of  36 190.
So basically If I don't eat for 10 days I should be shredded mofo. But I'l probably go for more realistic 500kcal deficit a day.
That's 72 days of consistently eating 2 866kcal or less.

I have 71.7kg (~158lbs) of lean mass and I need aroun 1g of protein per pound per day. Let's say 160g.
Each gram of protein is 4kcal so that's 640kcal just in protein.  I have 2226kcal that I can eat in fat and carbs.

I don't really care about the ratio of fat and carbs in my diet. I plan to continue eating whole foods - meat, eggs and vegetables,
nuts, sometimes wholewheat bread, pasta or rice. Therefore I assume that the other macronutrients will take care of themself. But just of of curiosity:

It's usually recomended for a male to eat around 35% of calories in fat. 35% x 2226kcal = 779kcal round it to 780.
Each gram of fat has 9kcal (more or less) so that's 87grams of fat daily.

The rest 1446kcal (1450kcal) I'll eat in carbs. Each gram of cabs is 4kcal. 1450/4 = 362g daily.

But as I said, I don't really care if I eat more carbs or fat. I plan to track my protein and overall calories.

## Adjustments
My BMR after this cut should be 1827. With the same activity multiplier that TDEE of 3 178kcal. My TDEE will be lower by 188kcal.
That mean I will have to eat 188kcal/day less just to not gain weight. And to keep losing weight with the same rate I'll have to slowly adjust
to eat only 2670kcal. And when I'm done I'll add around 500kcal back.
