# Goals for year 2019
I have two simple, but not easy goals, for this year.

## 1. Drivers licence
I plan to get a drivers lince for both cars and big motorcycles this year. I also want to buy a bike and start driving.

## 2. First fight
I do a Muay-Thai for about 6 months now and I feel I'm getting betting. I want to fight in amateur bout of Muay-Thai or K1 this year.
