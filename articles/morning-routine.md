# My Morning Routine

This is my morning warmup routine I perform every morning just after I wake up. No matter if I workout that day or not, on workdays and weekeds, on vacation, no excuses.

It's not carved into a stone though. I improve my routine, I add or remove stuff when I get bored. For example I used do sit-ups but since I started training thaibox I do a lots of them in my afternoon training. Therefore I switched them for plank in my morning routine. I also manage to read emails or watch a short video on youtube while planking.

Create your own morning routine and get disciplined.

Edit: In November 2018 I've changed 3 miunutes of plank for 35 sit-ups for the [30 days of discipline challange](/articles/30-day-of-discipline)
