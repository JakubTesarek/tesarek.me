# Make them look away
One of my goals from [30 days of discipline was to keep better eye contact](/30-day-of-discipline#8-keep-correct-posture).Practice makes perfect so I found myself a game I played every day on my way from and to work. On escalator escalotor I pick a person going the other direction and I keep an eye contact until they look away.

The beauty of this is you meet a lot of different people and you can choose your "opponent" - sometimes I choose just hot girls, sometimes big dudes. So far, the toughest foes were kids. They just don't give a shit.

Another interesting observation is that you can make anyone to move out of your way just by staring into their eyes and walking in your direction. Christmas is comming and with it overcrowded streets. This will be useful.
