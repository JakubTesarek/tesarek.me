# My eating rules

2 years ago I was 260lbs, now I'm 180lbs and can do 22 strict pull-ups. In the last 2 years I tried lot of diets and eating schedules - keto, low fat, 6 meals a day, OMAD, calorie counting. Everything that remotely made sense I tried, kept what worked and I was able to do in a long term. I got rid of the other nonsense and ended up with these rules:

## Eat 2 meals a day
I eat two square meals a day. A meal for me is a main course, maybe piece of fruit or nuts as a desert, sometimes with a proteing shake. I have my first meal around 11am and second meal around 7pm or when I get home from training. That's it. I don't snack at all.

## Every meal contains vegetables
Every meal must contain big portion of vegetables, ideally raw. If the meal isn't "vegetable based" I just buy a bell pepper, some carrots or a cucumber and eat it as a side dish. Only exceptions are foods that are bean based, like Chilli con carne, and oatmeal.

If I can't get vegetables for some reason, I simply skip that meal. On other hand, I allow myself to eat non-starchy vegetables (no potatoes) in any amount. Sometimes I just eat whole coliflower pound of carrots.

## Structure meals around protein source
I don't count macros or even care about them. I only make sure that base of food is protein - meat or eggs. That means I don't eat sweet food like pancakes because there's not enough protein.

> Soy is not a protein source. Soy turns is emasculating.

## Cheat only with food I really love
Sometime I have a cheat meal. But it's always something that I absolutely love. I don't spend my cheat meals on stuff that is just good. I don't cheat with potato chips. They are good and I like them but I like pizza way more. If I decide to cheat I go 100% for the best thing.

This rule helps me to keep my cheating to one meal and doesn't trigger a binge marathon. My cheat meal satisfies my enought I can get back to clean eating. There's nothing better to eat than what I just had anyway.

## Never eat office remains
This rule is basically redundant because of the previous one but I struggles with it so I had to make it explicit. There's lot of different celebrations in the office and often times some food remains, usually donuts, bagels and similiar. People always scavenge like vulters. It's a trap. It's a trap. Nothing good is ever free. 

## Weight myself every day
Some people say you should not weight yourself every day. Some people are idiots. How else you want to know how much you weight today? What if I'm loosing too much weight? What if I lost too much water on yeasterday training and sore because of it? People you say weighing is trigerring are pussies.

I also take pictures of myself sometimes. When I started loosing weight I took them exactly every 3 months but the difference now is not so significant so I stoped doing in on regular basis.

## Eat to full, not stuffed
I eat until I'm full. I like being full. That's why I couldn't do the body-building diet of 6 meals. I was never really full. But full doesn't mean stuffed. I still have to be able to run 10k under an hour straight after a meal.

## I can eat whatever on my own wedding
There are events when all rules go aside but they are rare - my own wedding for example. I won't give you a complete list but you'll recognize them when they happen to you. Just a hint, if the event happens every year, it's not rare.
